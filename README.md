    *   Annual Fee
    *   Reason for Recommendation
*   Clear and structured presentation of recommendations.

## Technologies Used

*   Python

*   Langchain (for the AI agent and logic)
*   Langchain-OpenAI (for interacting with OpenAI models)
*   Pydantic (for data validation and schema)
*   Dotenv (for environment variable management)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL> # Replace with the actual URL
    cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY>   # Replace with the actual directory name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## How to Run

*   Ensure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the project's root directory.
